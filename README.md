# ShyGnomeFox 3.8.1

A combination of the [ShyFox theme](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox) and the
[Firefox GNOME theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme).

Currently, it's neither very good nor very complete. Consider just using [ShadowRZ's ShyFox fork](https://github.com/ShadowRZ/ShyFox)
(upstream is unmaintained currently) or the [Firefox GNOME theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) instead.

## Usage

See ShyFox's README on
[installing](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox?tab=readme-ov-file#install),
[upgrading](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox?tab=readme-ov-file#upgrading),
[customizing](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox?tab=readme-ov-file#customization), and
[overview](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

## Options

New [about:config](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) options added by ShyGnomeFox.
See [ShyFox's README](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox?tab=readme-ov-file#options) or
[Firefox GNOME theme's README](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme#features) for more options.

Keep in mind that because ShyGnomeFox uses [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) for tab
management, a lot of Firefox GNOME theme's options aren't applicable to it, e.g. probably anything relating to tabs.

| Setting | true | false / not exist (default) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `shygnomefox.extra.rounded.corners` | Buttons use Firefox GNOME theme corner rounding | Buttons use ShyFox corner rounding |

## Compatibility

ShyGnomeFox is based and tested solely on the latest stable versions of everything.

As of the time of writing (2025-03-24), this is GNOME 47, Firefox 136, ShyFox 3.8.1, and Firefox GNOME Theme v136.
